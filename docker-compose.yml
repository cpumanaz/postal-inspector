# SECURITY NOTES:
# - Docker's default seccomp profile is applied to all containers (blocks ~44 dangerous syscalls)
# - All containers drop ALL capabilities and use no-new-privileges
# - Resource limits prevent DoS via memory/CPU exhaustion
# - Passwords configured via .env file (standard Docker Compose pattern)
